# Shell scripts to run the FreeSurfer recon-all pipeline in parallel

These two scripts serve to run `recon-all` in parallel using the [GNU parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/) software.

The parallelization happens on the subject level: there is no speedup for running a single subject,
but on a machine with 24 cores, you can run 24 subjects in parallel at any given time and expect roughly linear speedup.

See the script headers for detailed usage instructions.
