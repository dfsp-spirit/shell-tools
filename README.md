# shell-tools
Some handy shell scripts for BASH. I have these in ~/bin/ on all systems I use.

## About
See the individual scripts for details on what they do.

## Installation
You can copy all of the into your ~/bin/ directory by running `install.bash`.

## License
All of these scripts are released under very permissive licenses, see the script headers.
