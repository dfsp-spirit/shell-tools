# shell-tools
Some handy shell scripts for BASH. I have these in ~/bin/ on all systems I use.

## About

This repo contains several tools. See the individual script headers for more details on what they do.

### grid.bash

Generates an overview Markdown document from all image files in the directory where it is called. If `pandoc` is installed, it uses pandoc to convert the Markdown document to other handy format, e.g., HTML. Very handy if have generated a number of plots and want to discuss them with colleagues but avoid the hassle of searching for the correct ones in a file browser.

## Installation
You can copy all of the into your ~/bin/ directory by running `install.bash`.

## License
All of these scripts are released under very permissive licenses, see the script headers. Just assume MIT if I forgot to put a license.
